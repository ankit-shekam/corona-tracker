this project is a basic Covid 19 statistical tracking application
using api "https://covid19.mathdro.id/api"

initiatialized using "yarn create react-app" command
additional libraries use are: 


AXIOS:
Light weight HTTP client, similar to FETCH API
we can take advantage of async and await for more readable asynchronous code. 

REACT-CHARTJS-2:
great for graphs
"https://jerairrest.github.io/react-chartjs-2/"

CHARTJS:
graphjs-2 did not work till I used this 


CLASSNAMES:
to make the styling easier I use filename.module.css naming for css file
had to use classnames's cx component to use more than one css class from css files in a JSX element


@MATERIAL-UI/CORE:
similar to react-strap, boot-strap
